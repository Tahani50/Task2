# SwiftUI Names List App

## Description
This SwiftUI app displays a list of names using an array and the `List` view. Users can filter names based on a specific starting letter and sort them alphabetically.

## Features

- Filters names based on the first letter.
- Sorts the filtered names alphabetically when a button is tapped.

## How It Works
1. The app initially loads a predefined list of names.
2. The user can enter a letter in a `TextField`, and the list will update to show only names starting with that letter.
3. A button allows sorting the filtered names alphabetically when tapped.
4. Uses SwiftUI's `List`, `TextField`, and `Button` views along with state management (`@State`).

## How to Run
